You can play alone or with a partner.<br /><ul><li><b>General:</b>Boolitaire is a strategic card game based on Boolean logic.    Starting from a given bit string you have to establish a pyramid of logical gates. You achieve this by placing logical gates (represented by cards). A logical gate performs a Boolean operation on two inputs and returns a binary number. (1 or 0)</li><li><b>Single Player Mode:</b>You can play the game on multiple levels. On a higher level the start bits are changing fasters, which may disable lower cards. In TIME mode you have to be fast and in the STANDARD mode, it is important to make well-thought-out moves.</li><li><b>Multiplayer mode</b>Two players take turns on a device. While in SinglePlayer mode the bits of the start chain are changing randomly, in multiplayer mode you can change specific bits to destroy the pyramid of the opponent with the NOT card. The gameplay is turn-based.</li><li><b>Tutorial</b> The gameplay mechanics are explained in a tutorial. </li> <li><b>Settings:</b>    You can add the negating operators (NAND, NOR, XNOR), increase the difficulty and activate the TIME mode.</li></ul>",
